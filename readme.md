# Algorithms 1

This follows the Coursera course from Princeton taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert
Sedgewick. It's very well taught, and represents my first foray into Java, as 
well as my first formal data structures and algorithms course. So I want to keep
good notes for both those reasons. This repository is those notes.

The textbook is Algorithms by the same instructors.

### Notes for Running

In IntelliJ > Project Structure > Project Settings > Modules > Sources, label the `week-n` 
to Source Folders. Note if desired, here you can also specify folders as Tests. 
In Modules > Dependencies, you can add the `algs4.jar` to the dependency list to
make compilation easier. If, even with that, the compilation or running fails, 
you can always fall back to using `javac-algs4` and `java-algs4`.

After this, `Test.java` files should run with a simple `Run` command in IntelliJ.
