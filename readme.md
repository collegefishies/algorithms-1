# Algorithms 1

This follows the Coursera course from Princeton taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert
Sedgewick. It's very well taught, and represents my first foray into Java, as 
well as my first formal data structures and algorithms course. So I want to keep
good notes for both those reasons. This repository is those notes.

The textbook is Algorithms by the same instructors.
